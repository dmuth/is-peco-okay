    What's going on here is that resources.Concat caches output based on the filename.
    Problem is, this completely breaks development for me, because if I change the
    contents of a Javascript file, the final file won't be rebuilt unless I restart Hugo server.
    I spent about 45 minutes Googling around, and couldn't find anything that actually worked.
    So in a fit of frustration, I'm just going to set the filename to something dynamic, so
    that every time a Javascript is updated, Hugo will rebuild things (as it should), get a new
    time, and write a new file.

    This is SO annoying, but if there is a better method, I haven't found it yet.
