# About Is PECO Okay?

## Is this website official?

**No.**  This website is neither run nor endorsed by PECO.  It is my personal side-project.


## What is this website?

This website displays PECO outage stats across their entire customer base.
It is an alternative to [PECO's Official Status Page](https://www.peco.com/outages/experiencing-an-outage/outage-map). 


## Why was it built?

I found that when a storm comes through and I lose power, I would obsessively refresh the
PECO status page on my iPhone, to try and get an idea of how many outages they were, and 
how fast the number of outages was going down so that I had an idea of how fast service 
restoration was proceeding.

It certainly... worked.  However, I felt like it was overkill to refresh a page that had a map
on it.  I just wanted numbers, and to be able to see their improvement over time as restoration happened.

And here we are.


## Have You Built Anything Else?

Yep!  I've built a few things you may find interesting:

- [Diceware Password Generator](https://diceware.dmuth.org/)
- [FastAPI Httpbin](https://httpbin.dmuth.org/) - HTTP endpoints for testing.  Built with FastAPI.
- [Is SEPTA F\*cked?](https://www.isseptafucked.com/) - Like this site.  But for SEPTA.  And with 100% more profanity.
- [SEPTA Stats](https://septastats.com/) - Stats on Philadelphia Public Transit with 100% less profanity.
- [Splunk Lab](https://github.com/dmuth/splunk-lab) - Stand up a Splunk instance in 30 seconds
- [Tarsplit](https://github.com/dmuth/tarsplit) - Split a tarball on file boundaries
- ...or just [poke around my GitHub](https://github.com/dmuth)
